# Affordable Myoelectric Prosthetic Arm

## Overview  
This project was completed as part of the capstone at Drexel University's College of Engineering. Our goal was to design and develop an **affordable, 3D-printed myoelectric prosthetic arm** that mimics human limb functionality using tendon-driven mechanisms and EMG-based control. The project highlights our efforts to bridge the gap between high-functionality prosthetics and cost accessibility, delivering a solution that could be fabricated for under $350.
